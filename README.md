Traffic Volume Prediction 
The Traffic Volume Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately forecasts the volume of traffic on roads or highways based on historical data and various external factors. Accurate traffic volume prediction is essential for effective traffic management, reducing congestion, and improving road safety.

This project leverages historical traffic data along with additional features such as date and time, weather conditions, public holidays, and road events to train predictive models. Machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks are evaluated to determine the most effective approach.

The end goal is to create a robust prediction system that can be used by traffic authorities, urban planners, and navigation apps to make data-driven decisions for optimizing traffic flow and planning infrastructure.
